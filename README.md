When we attempt save the data from an excel file into a database via an api call. We might face multiple issues 

There is a threat of data loss during server downtime. Saving data to the database while the server is inaccessible could lead to potential loss of critical information. Hence we need to build some data recovery or data backup plan

The second issue is our inability to pinpoint the specific product associated with an error or failure, leaving us without a clear understanding of the root cause. When data fails to get saved in the database Identifying the error or reason for failure becomes extremely challenging. Also to pinpoint the pinpoint the specific product associated with an error or failure becomes hard.

Another challenge lies in the data itself, as it contains some missing values. These gaps in the data can lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies, impacting the reliability of our processes and analysis.

Features
Database Integration:
This feature ensures that when data passes through the API and successfully passes validation checks, it is saved in a database for persistent storage. By saving the validated records in a database, the application can later retrieve and analyze this data. This helps in maintaining a reliable and organized data repository, allowing the system to perform various operations and queries on the data efficiently.

Effective Error Handling:
During the process of data validation and database saving, errors may occur due to various reasons such as invalid data, database connectivity issues, or other technical problems. To handle such scenarios effectively, the API is designed to provide meaningful error messages to the Java application. These error messages explain the nature of the error, making it easier for developers to identify the root cause of the problem and implement appropriate solutions.

ErrorExcel Generation:
In cases where the API encounters failures while attempting to save records in the database, it generates an errorExcel. This errorExcel is a log or report that contains information about the records that couldn't be saved, along with the reasons for failure. This log is valuable for troubleshooting and identifying patterns of failure. With this information, developers can quickly locate and rectify issues, leading to more efficient error resolution.

Resend Mechanism:
To ensure data consistency and prevent data loss in the event of a failed API call, the solution incorporates a resend mechanism. When a failure occurs during the process of saving data to the database, the system initiates a mechanism that automatically retries sending the failed data. This helps in maintaining data integrity and ensures that no critical information is lost due to temporary errors or system glitches.

Detailed Error Messages:
The errorExcel generated by the system provides detailed and informative error messages. It includes information about which fields in each record contain null or invalid values. These detailed error messages aid developers in understanding the specific issues with the data and facilitate the debugging process. By pinpointing the exact problem areas, developers can quickly address and fix the issues, leading to a more robust and reliable application.

Overall, these features work together to enhance the reliability, maintainability, and usability of the API makes it easy to handle the errors effectively.


Future Scope:

Extended Data Validation:
To ensure data accuracy and integrity, the data validation in the service layer can be extended to cover more comprehensive checks. This means implementing custom validation rules based on specific business requirements. By incorporating additional checks, the system can prevent the entry of invalid or inconsistent data, leading to higher data quality and reliability. These custom validation rules can cater to unique business scenarios and domain-specific requirements, making the application more robust and tailored to the organization's needs.

Concurrency Implementation:
Introducing concurrency in the system allows simultaneous processing of multiple API calls. This enhancement can significantly improve the efficiency and speed of data processing. By leveraging multi-threading or asynchronous processing, the system can handle multiple requests concurrently, effectively utilizing available resources and reducing response times. This helps to achieve better scalability and responsiveness, especially during peak usage periods or when dealing with large volumes of data.

API Response Caching:
Implementing API response caching can temporarily store validated records in memory. When a request is made for data that has already been validated, the system can respond with the cached data instead of performing the entire validation process again. This reduces redundant API calls for duplicate data, which leads to improved transmission efficiency and minimized API usage. Caching can significantly reduce response times and server load, resulting in a smoother user experience and optimized resource utilization.

These future scope enhancements aim to take the existing system to the next level by focusing on data quality, processing efficiency, and performance optimization. By incorporating more comprehensive data validation, enabling concurrency for simultaneous processing, and implementing API response caching, the system can become more robust, scalable, and user-friendly. These improvements contribute to the overall success of the application, ensuring it meets evolving business needs and remains competitive in a rapidly changing technological landscape.
